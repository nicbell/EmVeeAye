# ‚ôªÔ∏è EmVeeAye [![](https://jitpack.io/v/net.nicbell/emveeaye.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#net.nicbell/emveeaye)

Some kinda MVI, heavily inspired by everything but with much less stuff.

## üôãüèΩ Why

I wanted a YAGNI approach to MVI and unidirectional data flow using coroutines `StateFlow`. Instead
of lots of separate classes, handing intents, producing actions, reducing and state emission can
happen inside the view model. Then just test the sequence of emission from the view model. Of course
if you use this library and like having lots of files and jumping around, by all means enjoy
yourself.

#### Intents vs actions

How do these differ? What you want is not always what you get.

You're feeling a bit sleepy, your intent is to have a cup of coffee. You handle your intent by checking to see if there is any coffee, after that your action may be to have a coffee or not have a coffee. One of these actions may reduce you to a less sleepy state, the other will leave you sleepy as well as disappointed.

## ü™ú Setup

Include the dependency in your project.

```groovy
implementation "net.nicbell.emveeaye:emveeaye:x.x.x"
```

In order to download the dependency please make sure access to the Maven repository is configured.
You can use JitPack or GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>From JitPack</summary>

JitPack is full configured to work with
the [custom domain](https://jitpack.io/#net.nicbell/emveeaye/latest). Just included the Maven
repository and add the dependency as described above.

```gradle
maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>From GitHub</summary>

This repo is public but GitHub's Maven Repository needs authentication.

```gradle
maven {
    name = "GitHubPackages"
    url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/nicbell/EmVeeAye")
    credentials {
        username = github_user
        password = github_token
    }
}
```

To download EmVeeAye you will need to create
a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `read:packages` scope.

Please do not push your tokens to GitHub, you can store them in `local.properties` instead.

```properties
githubName="username"
githubToken="xxx"
```

## üèÑüèΩ Usage

State is a data class. Intents, actions are sealed classes. The view Model receives intents and
transforms them to actions. Actions are used to update the state via a reducer
function `(state, action) -> new state`.

```kotlin
class MyViewModel : MVIViewModel<MyIntent, MyState, MyAction>(
    initialState = MyState(),
    reducer = { state, action ->
        when (action) {
            is MyAction.ShowContent -> state.copy(data = action.data)
            is MyAction.ShowError -> state.copy(error = action.error)
        }
    }
) {
    // You will need to implement `onIntent` to handle all your intents
    override fun onIntent(intent: MyIntent) = when (intent) {
        MyIntent.LoadContent -> handleLoadContent()
        MyIntent.DoSomething -> handleSomethingAction()
    }

    private fun handleLoadContent() = withState {
        updateState(MyAction.ShowContent(listOf("Test")))
    }

    private fun handleSomethingAction() = withState {
        updateState(MyAction.ShowError("I don't want to do anything."))
    }
}
```

In your activity or fragment you can observe state changes.

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    private val vm: MyViewModel by viewModel()

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        //..

        observeFlow(vm.state) { updateUI(it) }
    }
    //..
}
```

If you like to have separate classes for reducer functions you can use those by implementing
the `Reducer` type alias.

```kotlin
class MyStateReducer : Reducer<MyState, MyAction> {
    override fun invoke(state: MyState, action: MyAction) = when (action) {
        is MyAction.ShowContent -> state.copy(data = action.data)
        is MyAction.ShowError -> state.copy(error = action.error)
    }
}

class MyViewModel : MVIViewModel<MyIntent, MyState, MyAction>(
    initialState = MyState(),
    reducer = MyStateReducer()
) {
    //..
}
```

#### Saving state

The view model constructor accepts a `SavedStateHandle` which is `null` by default. When
a `SavedStateHandle` is supplied the state is automatically restored and saved with each state
update.

‚ö†Ô∏è Your state will have to be `Parcelable` inorder to be saved by `SavedStateHandle`.

```kotlin
class MyViewModel(savedStateHandle: SavedStateHandle) : MVIViewModel<MyIntent, MyState, MyAction>(
    initialState = MyState(),
    reducer = { state, action -> /**/ },
    savedStateHandle = savedStateHandle
) {
    //..
}
```

## üî¨ Testing

Include the testing dependency in your project.

```groovy
testImplementation "net.nicbell.emveeaye:emveeaye-test:x.x.x"
```

The `ViewModelTest` class allows us to test the flow of state emitted from the view model.

```kotlin
class MyViewModelTest : ViewModelTest() {

    private val vm = MyViewModel()

    @Test
    fun myTest() = runTest {
        // WHEN
        vm.onIntent(MyIntent.LoadContent)

        // THEN
        vm.state.assertFlow(
            MyState(),
            MyState(data = listOf("Test"))
        )
    }

    @Test
    fun myTest2() = runTest {
        // WHEN
        vm.onIntent(MyIntent.DoSomething)

        // THEN
        vm.state.assertFlow(
            MyState(),
            MyState(error = "I don't want to do anything.")
        )
    }
}
```

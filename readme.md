# ♻️ EmVeeAye
Some kinda MVI, heavily inspired by everything but with much less stuff.

### 🙋🏽‍️ Why
I wanted a YAGNI approach to MVI and unidirectional data flow using coroutines `StateFlow`. You won’t find any state handler or reducer classes here. Of course if you use this library and like those things, by all means enjoy yourself.

### 🧩 Setup
Include the dependency in your project.
```groovy
implementation "net.nicbell.emveeaye:lib:x.x.x"
```

In order to download the dependency please make sure access to the GitHub Maven repository is configured. Repo is public but GitHub needs authentication anyway.
```gradle
maven {
    name = "GitHubPackages"
    url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/nicbell/EmVeeAye")
    credentials {
        username = github_user
        password = github_token
    }
}
```
To download EmVeeAye you will need to create a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `read:packages` scope.

Please do not push your tokens to GitHub, you can store them in `local.properties` instead.
```properties
githubName="username"
githubToken="xxx"
```

### 🏎 Usage

Intents, states and events (side-effects) are sealed classes. View Model receives intents and performs an action that emits states and events.

```kotlin
class MyViewModel : MVIViewModel<MyIntent, MyState, MyEvent>(MyState.Empty) {
    
    // You will need to implement `onIntent` to handle all your intents
    override fun onIntent(intent: MainIntent) = when (intent) {
        MyIntent.LoadContent -> loadContentAction()
        MyIntent.DoSomething -> doSomethingAction()
    }

    // This action can only run in MyState.Empty
    private fun loadContentAction() = actionOn<MyState.Empty> {
        setState(MyState.Loaded(listOf(Dummy)))
    }

    // This action can run in any state
    private fun doSomethingAction() = action {
        sendEvent(MyEvent.Error("I don't want to do anything."))
    }
}
```
